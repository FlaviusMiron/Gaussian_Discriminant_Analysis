# Gaussian_Discriminant_Analysis

Script that implements the Gaussian Discriminant Analysis model and compares its results with a logistic regression model. Plots the learned Gaussians and the decision boundaries
for both models. 

Only "gaussian_discriminant_analysis.py" has to be run as this script will automatically import and make use of the logistic regression model. For detailed explanation on the
equation used for deriving the decision boundary, check the pdf file.
